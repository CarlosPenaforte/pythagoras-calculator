# Pythagoras Calculator App

This app was created using ReactJs. It contains a pythagoras calculator developed using _react-tabs_ for choosing if the user want to calculate the hypotenuse or a catheto of a right triangle.

## Content:

### react-tabs

The tabs _Hypotenuse_ and _Catheto_ can be selected to calculate the respective segment. Once a tab is selected, the respective panel is shown.

### Form:

Forms are in each panel, containing the inputs and calculation needed to each case. These forms also have a container for printing the result of the calculation.
For calculating the results and developing the reactive components, the hooks _useState_ and _useEffect_ were used.

### Background:

The app contains an animated background, made with CSS' _linear-gradient_ and _@keyframes_.
